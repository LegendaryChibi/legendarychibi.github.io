Hi!

I'm Joshua Varghese, an Award Winning Game Programmer with a strong background in creating systems, databases, and design. My notable work includes REVEREX where I developed custom a custom minigame system to play and queue multiple games at a time. 

I specialize in Unity, SQL, C#, C++, and Python but I am also familiar with other game developer tools such as Visual Studio, Trello, and HacknPlan. My ultimate goal is to become a Producer at a AAA company like Blizzard or Rockstar, and I'm driven by a passion for **creating immersive gaming experiences, leading teams, and bringing large-scale projects to life**.

As a natural leader I excel at solving problems as well as guiding and inspiring others to do the same. I wish to help create safe and creative spaces with other team members to **foster growth, and success** for everyone involved.
