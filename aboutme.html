      <p>Hi! I'm Joshua Varghese, an award-winning Game Programmer with a strong background in creating systems, databases, and code flows. I'm also a well versed Discord Bot Developer with 5 years of hobbyist experience. With Reverex being my first award winning game I'd also like to share that I engineered a unique minigame system that allows players to play and queue multiple games simultaneously. I also primarily coded and designed the final versions of each minigame while incorporating them into other systems as well!</p>
      
      <p>I have multiple years worth of experience in Unity, SQL, C#, C++, and Python both from my time as a Discord Bot Developer and Student Game Developer. My final career goal is to become a Producer at a AAA game company like Blizzard or Rockstar. I wish to fully imbue myself with the development of high quality games and be a major contributer to their releases. And with every project I partake in I'm driven by my passion for <strong>creating immersive gaming experiences, leading teams, and bringing ambitious projects to life</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>As solutions oriented person, I excel at solving problems as well as guiding and inspiring others to do the same.</p>
