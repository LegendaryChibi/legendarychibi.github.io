      <h1>Hi!</h1>
      <p>I'm <strong>Joshua Varghese</strong>, an award-winning <strong>Game Programmer</strong> with a strong background in creating systems, databases, and design. My notable work includes <strong>REVEREX</strong>, where I developed a custom minigame system to play and queue multiple games at a time.</p>
      
      <p>I specialize in <strong>Unity, SQL, C#, C++,</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, but I am also familiar with other game developer tools such as <strong>Visual Studio, Trello,</strong> and <strong>HacknPlan</strong>. My ultimate goal is to become a <strong>Producer</strong> at a AAA company like <strong>Blizzard</strong> or <strong>Rockstar</strong>, and I'm driven by a passion for <strong>creating immersive gaming experiences, leading teams, and bringing large-scale projects to life</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>As a natural leader, I excel at solving problems as well as guiding and inspiring others to do the same. I wish to help create safe and creative spaces with other team members to <strong>foster growth and success</strong> for everyone involved.</p>
