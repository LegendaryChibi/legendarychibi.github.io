      <p>Hi! I'm Joshua Varghese, an award-winning Game Programmer with a strong background in creating systems, databases, and design. My notable work includes REVEREX, where I developed a custom minigame system to play and queue multiple games at a time.</p>
      
      <p>I specialize in Unity, SQL, C#, C++, and Python, but I am also familiar with other game developer tools such as <strong>Visual Studio, Trello, and HacknPlan. My ultimate goal is to become a Producer at a AAA company like Blizzard or Rockstar, and I'm driven by a passion for <strong>creating immersive gaming experiences, leading teams, and bringing large-scale projects to life</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>As a natural leader, I excel at solving problems as well as guiding and inspiring others to do the same. I wish to help create safe and creative spaces with other team members to <strong>foster growth and success for everyone involved.</strong></p>
